# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using RFM Clustering (Online Retail Dataset)

This project performs customer segmentation using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis and clustering techniques on the popular **Online Retail dataset**. The goal is to identify different customer groups and help businesses tailor marketing strategies for each segment.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Online Retail** dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains transactional data from a UK-based online retail store.

## 📊 Key Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- RFM Feature Engineering
- Log Transformation & Scaling
- Clustering:
  - **KMeans**
  - **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering**
- Elbow Method & Dendrogram
- Cluster Visualization using `matplotlib` & `seaborn`

---

## 🧠 Objective

To segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using **RFM Analysis** and apply clustering techniques to uncover hidden patterns in customer data.

---

## 📌 Results

- **4 clusters** were found to be optimal based on Elbow and Dendrogram analysis.
- Each cluster reflects unique customer characteristics:
  - High-frequency & high-monetary = **Loyal/Premium**
  - Low-frequency & low-monetary = **Churned/Inactive**
  - Recent buyers with low purchase history = **New/One-time buyers**
  - Moderate across RFM = **Potential loyal**

This segmentation allows businesses to:
- **Reward loyal customers**
- **Re-engage inactive users**
- **Nurture new customers**
